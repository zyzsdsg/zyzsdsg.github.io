Among the various types of options, the European option plays a central role, as it admits a closed-form solution. Therefore, to build a comprehensive understanding of FE, the first step is to study the European option. This chapter introduces the essential mathematical tools needed to analyze and price such instruments.\nWhat is a Derivatives? A derivative is a financial contract between two counterparties whose value depends on the performance of an underlying asset. When entering into an option contract, the parties agree on several key terms: the maturity date, the underlying asset, and the strike price. A European option is a type of derivative whose payoff depends solely on the price of the underlying asset at the maturity date.\nIn an option contract, the buyer has the right, but not the obligation, to exercise the option if it is favorable. Because of this right, the option buyer must pay a premium (the option price) at the initial time. The seller, in turn, accepts the obligation to fulfill the contract if the buyer decides to exercise.\nThe central task of option pricing theory is to determine the fair option price—that is, the price at which both counterparties are willing to enter into the agreement. This price ensures that neither party has an arbitrage opportunity and that the risk is fairly compensated.\nElements of pricing a option. To price an option, we need a model for its underlying asset, which is most commonly a stock. The Black–Scholes model assumes that the dynamics of the stock price follow the stochastic differential equation (SDE):\n$$ dS_t = \\mu S_t dt + \\sigma S_t dB_t $$ where $S_t$ is the stock price at time $t$, $\\mu$ is the drift term, $\\sigma$ is the volatility (diffusion term), and $B_t$ denotes a standard Brownian motion.\nTo fully understand this equation, one must first understand the concept of Brownian motion. Brownian motion is a stochastic process with normally distributed increments, continuous paths, and independent stationary increments. It serves as the mathematical foundation for modeling random fluctuations in financial markets.\nBrownian Motion At time (t = 0), a standard Brownian motion satisfies:\n$$ B_0 = 0 $$\nIncrement Distribution The increment of Brownian motion over a small interval ([t, t+dt]) is defined as:\n$$ dB_t = B_{t+dt} - B_t $$\nand it follows a normal distribution with mean (0) and variance (dt):\n$$ dB_t \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, dt) $$\nIndependent Increments If two intervals do not overlap, say ((u,v)) and ((m,n)), then the increments are independent random variables:\n$$ B_v - B_u, \\quad B_n - B_m $$\nNormal Distributon The normal distribution is a fundamental distribution, and its equation is:\n$$ \\int^{\\infty}_{-\\infty}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi \\sigma}}e^{-\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}}dx = 1 $$ Where $\\mu$ is the mean of the random variable $x$, $\\sigma ^2$ is the variance of $x$.\nFor the Browain motion, if the time interval is 1, the mean is 0 and variance is 1, which reduces to standard normal distribution, and its equation is: $$ \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} e^{-\\frac{x^2}{2}} dx = 1 $$\nIf the interval is $t$ not 1, the equation change to: $$ \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi t}} e^{-\\frac{x^2}{2t}} dx = 1 $$\nThese are called cumulative distribution functions (CDFs).\nIf we consider the probability of a random variable $X$ being less than a number $x$, and denote the CDF as $F$, then the expression $F(x)$ means the probability of the random variable being less than $x$.\n$$ F(x) = P(X \\leq x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^x \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi t}} , e^{-\\frac{x^2}{2t}} dx $$\nThe derivative of $F(x)$ is the probability density function (PDF).\nFor the standard normal distribution: $$ f(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} e^{-\\frac{x^2}{2}} $$\nFor the Brownian motion $B_t$ at time $t$, since $B_t \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,t)$: $$ f(B_t) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi t}} e^{(-\\frac{B_t^2}{2t})} $$\n","date":1755993600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1755993600,"objectID":"01f3eabd16027db1acc20e411df457fc","permalink":"https://zyzsdsg.github.io/math/calculus/browrainmotion/","publishdate":"2025-08-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/math/calculus/browrainmotion/","section":"math","summary":"In financial engineering (FE), one of the most fundamental tasks is option pricing.

The financial meaning will cover in another part.\nRules of Calculus. Since Brownian motion has independent increments, we know that\n$$ B_t \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, t). $$\nThus, its cumulative distribution function (CDF) is\n$$ F(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^x \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi t}} e^\\left(-\\frac{y^2}{2t}\\right) dy. $$\nBy definition, the probability density function (PDF) is the derivative of the CDF:\n$$ f(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} F(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}\\int_{-\\infty}^x \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi t}} e^\\left(-\\frac{y^2}{2t}\\right) dy. $$\nIntuitively, one may think of the differentiation operator $\\frac{d}{dx}$ and the integration sign $\\int$ as inverse operations when they are applied closely together.\nAlthough this is not fully rigorous, it reflects the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, which justifies exchanging the derivative and the integral in this case.\nTherefore, the PDF of Brownian motion at time $t$ is\n$$ f(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi t}} e^\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{2t}\\right). $$\nExpectation of Brownian Motion We want to compute the mean of Brownian motion at time $t$:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[B_t] = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi t}} e^\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{2t}\\right) dx. $$\nThis integral looks complicated, but notice that the integrand involves $x e^{-x^2/(2t)}$, which is (up to a constant factor) the derivative of a Gaussian exponential.\nIndeed, $$ \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( e^{-\\frac{x^2}{2t}} \\right) = -\\frac{x}{t} e^{-\\frac{x^2}{2t}}. $$\nTherefore, $$ x e^{-\\frac{x^2}{2t}} = -t \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(e^{-\\frac{x^2}{2t}}\\right). $$\nPlugging this into the expectation integral, we get\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[B_t] = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi t}} e^{-\\frac{x^2}{2t}} dx = -\\frac{t}{\\sqrt{2\\pi t}} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(e^{-\\frac{x^2}{2t}}\\right) dx. $$ Now, applying the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, $$ \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(e^{-\\frac{x^2}{2t}}\\right) dx = \\left. e^{-\\frac{x^2}{2t}} \\right|_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} = 0 - 0 = 0. $$ Hence, $$ \\mathbb{E}[B_t] = 0. $$\nVariance of Brownian Motion The variance of Brownian motion at time $t$ is defined as\n$$ \\mathrm{Var}(B_t) = \\mathbb{E}[B_t^2] - \\big(\\mathbb{E}[B_t]\\big)^2. $$\nSince we have already shown that $\\mathbb{E}[B_t] = 0$, this reduces to\n$$ \\mathrm{Var}(B_t) = \\mathbb{E}[B_t^2]. $$\nBy definition of expectation under the density of $B_t \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,t)$,\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[B_t^2] = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi t}} e^`\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{2t}\\right) dx. $$\nStep 1: Integration by Parts Setup Recall the integration by parts formula (from the product rule):\n$$ \\int f(x), g’(x), dx = f(x)g(x) - \\int f’(x), g(x), dx. $$\nWe choose:\n$f(x) = x$, so $f’(x) = 1$, $g’(x) = x \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi t}} e^{-\\frac{x^2}{2t}}$,\nso that the integrand $x^2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi t}} e^{-\\frac{x^2}{2t}}$ is represented. Step 2: Derivative Identity Notice that\n$$ \\frac{d}{dx}\\left( e^{-\\frac{x^2}{2t}} \\right) = -\\frac{x}{t} e^{-\\frac{x^2}{2t}}. $$\nThis identity will help simplify the calculation.\nUse substitution rules, $\\sqrt{t}y = x$, we have\nStep 3: Known Result Alternatively, we can recognize that $B_t \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,t)$ is a normal random variable.\nFor a normal distribution $\\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2)$, we know\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[X^2] = \\sigma^2. $$\nThus directly,\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[B_t^2] = t. $$\nFinal Result Therefore, the variance of Brownian motion is\n$$ \\mathrm{Var}(B_t) = t. $$\n","date":1755993600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1755993600,"objectID":"9e82e3545f3181fadff1d22bf247a4b8","permalink":"https://zyzsdsg.github.io/math/calculus/calculus/","publishdate":"2025-08-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/math/calculus/calculus/","section":"math","summary":"This section uses Brownian motion as a worked example to illustrate how calculus can be applied to derive the Black–Scholes formula mathematically.
